# Number_Guessing_Game

This project features a number guessing game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to correctly guess a random number between 1 to 100 with a total number of 10 guesses allowed. The player will be told whether their inputted guess is lower or higher than the hidden random number. A complete history of the player's prior guesses is also provided. Finally, the option to play the game again from scratch will be given.
